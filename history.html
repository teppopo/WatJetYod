	<meta name="description" content="Wat Jet Yod, Historical Wat Jed Yod or Wat Bhotharam Maha Vihara is located outside Chiang Mai City on the northwest on the bank of Mae Khan River. It is considered as an important historical site in Thailand. The temple was built by King Tilokaraj (the 9th King of Mungrai dynasty 1442-1487 A.D.) as the residence of Phra Uthamapanya Mahathera, a revered monk who was the abbot of the temple during the Buddhist Lent in 1455 A.D..
				The Bhoti A Bhoti tree was also planted to remind one of the time when Lord Buddha was confronted by Mara (the devil who tried to prevent him from attaining enlightenment). Seven of other significant places were also set up to imitate the place which Lord Buddha visited and enjoyed great peace for seven days each before going out to spread his teaching. The places are the Bhoti Tree Seat or Throne, Animis Chedi, Ratana Jongkrom, Ratana Ghara Chedi, Rajayatana Chedi, Achapalanikroth and Mondopa of Mujjalinta pond. 
				The Bhoti Throne (present day Chedi Jedyod) was modeled after the architectural style of the pagoda at Maha Bhoti Vihara in India whose outside wall was decorated with the stucco relief of an assembly of angels of deities. The first revision of the Tripitaka text was held here for the first time in Thailand, the eighth time in the world, in A.D. 1477, which took one year to complete. The revision was chaired by Phra Thamthin Mahathera of Wat Patan who represented the monks and king Tolokaraja who represented the lay people. The temple was granted the name 'Bhotharam Maha Vihara' because it had the Bhoti tree and the great Vihara on its premises. However, since the Vihara had seven pagoda on top of it, the people often referred to it as 'Wat Jedyod' or temple with seven spires (or pagoda).
				After King After king Tilokaraj's death in A.D. 1487, king Yod Chiangrai, his nephew, commanded his subject to build a crematorium, and a big pagoda was also built to keep his ashes and relics in. 
				In the time of king Muang Kaeo A.D. 1495-1525, these places were restored and an Ubosoth and other structures were added and were surrounded by walls, having the main gate (Sum Pratukhong) on the east. Wat Jedyod was deserted for a while until the early Rattanakosin period when King Kawila of Chiang Mai A.D. 1796, came to revive the city and to restore several buildings in Chiang Mai, Including Wat Jedyod.
				Style of Wat Jed-Yod The Wat Jed Yod is an attractive Lanna era temple complex in the outskirts of Chiang Mai that contains some very unique architecture.
				The temple that is also known as Wat Chet Yot and Wat Photharam Maha Vihara is a Royal temple dating back to the 15th century. The architectural style of the Wat shows Lanna, Rattanakosin, Lao, Chinese and Indian influence. The temple was built during the reign of King Tilokkarat, King of the Lanna Kingdom from 1441 until 1487. The King's ashes are enshrined in a chedi on the temple grounds. In 1477 the 8th World Buddhist Council was held here to discuss the texts of the Tripitaka, the scriptures containing the Buddhist teachings.">
	<meta name="keywords" content="How to get to the Wat Jed Yod The Wat Jed Yod is located in the North West part of Chiang Mai city, 
				around 2 kilometers from the old walled city center. The temple is found 
				just North of the Chiang Mai to Lampang superhighway (Highway 11), 
				a few hundred meters from the Chiang Mai National Museum. To get there, 
				take a tuk tuk (agree on the price before setting off) or drive there 
				yourself on a rented bicycle.
				The viharn with 7 peaks Highlight of the Wat Jed Yod is the viharn, where the temple derives its name from. Jed Yod means 7 peaks, referring to the 7 chedi's on top of the structure. The viharn is built in a style completely different from the other Lanna style or more recent Rattanakosin style structures. It was probably modelled after the Mahabodhi temple in Bagan (Myanmar) or the Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya in India, where the Buddha reached enlightenment.
				The outer walls of the viharn are decorated with 70 Thewada figures, a kind of celestial beings, in different postures. The bas reliefs are sculpted with a very high level of detail. While some of the figures are still in very good condition, some have unfortunately been damaged or all missing altogether.
				Inside the viharn is a large seated Buddha on a pedestal with a somewhat smaller Buddha image in front of it placed opposite the entrance. One of the sides of the viharn contains a tunnel like structure where a large sitting Buddha image is enshrined. Next to the viharn are two large gongs and a number of bells. Behind the viharn is the more modern ubosot or ordination hall.
				Three chedi's There are three chedi's or pagodas on the temple grounds.
				The largest chedi named the Phra Chedi has a square shape with niches on all four sides and a tall spire on top. It was built in 1487 to enshrine the ashes of King Tilokkarat. This Lanna style chedi also contains the Phra Kan Janthra Buddha image.
				Another chedi, set on a brick base has collapsed. The third chedi, with an octagonal shape and multiple levels containing niches, is set on a square brick base. The top of the structure is missing.
				The second viharn of the Wat Jed Yod is a very elegant typical Lanna style viharn with a three tiered roof and ornately decorated facade. Naga snakes on either side of the stairs are guarding the entrance.
				A large Bodhi tree on the grounds that is said to have been planted by King Tilokkarat himself is a descendant of the tree under which the Buddha meditated and reached enlightenment.
				The Wat Jed Yod is an active temple, monks live and study here. The large, spacious grounds are usually quiet, the temple is not much visited by foreign tourists. The tranquil grounds with lots of shady trees and picnic tables make it a nice place for a few relaxed hours.
				Entrance fee & opening hours The temple grounds are open daily from 6 am until 6 pm. Admission is free, although donations are highly appreciated.">
