				<p>&emsp;&emsp;Wat Jed Yod or Wat Bhotharam Maha Vihara is located outside Chiang Mai City on the northwest on the bank of Mae Khan River. It is considered as an important historical site in Thailand. The temple was built by King Tilokaraj (the 9th King of Mungrai dynasty 1442-1487 A.D.) as the residence of Phra Uthamapanya Mahathera, a revered monk who was the abbot of the temple during the Buddhist Lent in 1455 A.D..

				<p>&emsp;&emsp;A Bhoti tree was also planted to remind one of the time when Lord Buddha was confronted by Mara (the devil who tried to prevent him from attaining enlightenment). Seven of other significant places were also set up to imitate the place which Lord Buddha visited and enjoyed great peace for seven days each before going out to spread his teaching. The places are the Bhoti Tree Seat or Throne, Animis Chedi, Ratana Jongkrom, Ratana Ghara Chedi, Rajayatana Chedi, Achapalanikroth and Mondopa of Mujjalinta pond. 
				The Bhoti Throne (present day Chedi Jedyod) was modeled after the architectural style of the pagoda at Maha Bhoti Vihara in India whose outside wall was decorated with the stucco relief of an assembly of angels of deities. The first revision of the Tripitaka text was held here for the first time in Thailand, the eighth time in the world, in A.D. 1477, which took one year to complete. The revision was chaired by Phra Thamthin Mahathera of Wat Patan who represented the monks and king Tolokaraja who represented the lay people. The temple was granted the name "Bhotharam Maha Vihara" because it had the Bhoti tree and the great Vihara on its premises. However, since the Vihara had seven pagoda on top of it, the people often referred to it as "Wat Jedyod" or temple with seven spires (or pagoda).

				<p>&emsp;&emsp;After king Tilokaraj's death in A.D. 1487, king Yod Chiangrai, his nephew, commanded his subject to build a crematorium, and a big pagoda was also built to keep his ashes and relics in. 
				In the time of king Muang Kaeo A.D. 1495-1525, these places were restored and an Ubosoth and other structures were added and were surrounded by walls, having the main gate (Sum Pratukhong) on the east. Wat Jedyod was deserted for a while until the early Rattanakosin period when King Kawila of Chiang Mai A.D. 1796, came to revive the city and to restore several buildings in Chiang Mai, Including Wat Jedyod.

				The Wat Jed Yod is an attractive Lanna era temple complex in the outskirts of Chiang Mai that contains some very unique architecture.
				The temple that is also known as Wat Chet Yot and Wat Photharam Maha Vihara is a Royal temple dating back to the 15th century. The architectural style of the Wat shows Lanna, Rattanakosin, Lao, Chinese and Indian influence. The temple was built during the reign of King Tilokkarat, King of the Lanna Kingdom from 1441 until 1487. The King's ashes are enshrined in a chedi on the temple grounds. In 1477 the 8th World Buddhist Council was held here to discuss the texts of the Tripitaka, the scriptures containing the Buddhist teachings.
